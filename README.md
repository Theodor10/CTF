# CTF
Here I post source code form varios CTF challanges

I posted 2 py files with solutions for Basic-mod1 and Basic-mod2 from PicoCTF2022,the latter posed a little challange because i didn't heard about Modular multiplicative inverse until now.
I also solved File Type and other 3 challanges but it didn't require source code.

Added 2 files on CyberDefenders Hawkeye and Bucket challange
